This project is a Sudoku solver implemented in Java using the backtracking algorithm. The program takes an unsolved Sudoku board as input and provides the solved board as output. The backtracking algorithm is a depth-first search algorithm that tries to fill in the board step by step, backtracking when a conflict is found.

Features:
Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.
Uses the backtracking algorithm for efficient and effective solving.
Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.
